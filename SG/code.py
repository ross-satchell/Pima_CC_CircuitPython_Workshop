# code.py - CONTROLLER (MVC pattern)
#
# The Controller is the "glue" that connects the Model and View.
# It is the entry point that CircuitPython runs on boot.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Initialise all hardware via the /API modules
#   2. Create the Model (game state) and View (display/audio)
#   3. Poll inputs every loop iteration:
#      - CapTouch pad (A5) toggles demo/manual mode
#      - IMU accelerometer tilt sets the snake direction
#   4. Advance the game (model.step()) at a fixed tick rate
#   5. Route events from the Model to the View:
#      - "ate_food" --> update score label + play eat sound
#      - "died"     --> play death sound + flash red + show overlay + reset
#      - None       --> just redraw the grid
#
# Data flow each loop iteration:
#
#   Hardware Inputs                      Screen / Audio / LEDs
#        |                                       ^
#        v                                       |
#   CONTROLLER                              CONTROLLER
#   poll_inputs()                           view.render()
#        |                                  view.play_sfx()
#        v                                       ^
#   MODEL                                        |
#   model.set_direction()                   event = model.step()
#   model.toggle_demo()                          |
#                                          (routes event to View)
#
# The Model never calls the View.  The View never reads inputs.
# All communication flows through the Controller.
